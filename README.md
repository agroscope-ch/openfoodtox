This R package provides convenient access to the data extracted from some of
the spreadsheet files made available as OpenFoodTox, the chemical hazards
database of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The original files have
been published under the 
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) 
licence and can be accessed via
the [EFSA website](https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/data-report/chemical-hazards-database-openfoodtox)
or directly at
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.780543).

## Usage

The core component of the package is the data object `oft`, which contains the
data from four OpenFoodTox spreadsheets which are currently relevant for our
group at Agroscope. These are the spreadsheets on substance characterisation,
EFSA outputs, reference points and reference values.

When using this R package, the data are available in the form of
a [`dm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dm) object. Basically, a
`dm` object is a list of tables with defined relations.

## Documentation

A graphical representation of these tables and their relations and some
usage examples are shown in the
[documentation of the `oft` object](https://jranke.github.io/openfoodtox/reference/oft.html).

For further information on relational data models as implemented in the
[`dm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dm) package, please refer to its
[online documentation](https://dm.cynkra.com/).

## Installation from github (does not work yet)

```
remotes::install_github("jranke/openfoodtox")
```

You can then load the package in R

```
library(OpenFoodTox)
```

to have the data object `oft` available.
